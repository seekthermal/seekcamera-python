Welcome! :wave:

This is the official home of the Python language bindings for the Seek Thermal SDK. :snake:

## About :scroll:

In general, the [Seek Thermal SDK](https://developer.thermal.com) allows customers to develop applications that interface with our thermal camera cores easily, flexibly, and efficiently.
In addition, examples are provided to demonstrate the use of several functional areas and can be a starting point for your own projects.

The Python language bindings supplement and extend the SDK's traditional C interface in a higher-level language.
They require the Seek Thermal SDK 4.X to be pre-installed on the system; they also require a Seek Thermal OEM core to be physically attached to the system.

Visit our [website](https://thermal.com) for more information and to get your [Starter Kit](https://www.thermal.com/oem.html).

## Features :test_tube:

The Python language bindings mirror all the major functionality in our SDK.

### Highlights :confetti_ball:

* Asynchronous event driven API that is fast and responsive
* Ability to use multiple cameras in one SDK instance
* Common set of APIs for both Mosaic and Micro Core cameras
* Robust error handling and logging interface
* Numerous frame output formats
* Example applications to learn and get started

### Supported platforms :electric_plug:

The Python language bindings will run on a wide variety of common processors and Linux/Windows OSs.

The requirements are
* Python 3.X
* [numpy](https://numpy.org) >= 1
* Host architecture supported by the SDK
  * See the official SDK documentation for more information

The optional dependencies are
* [opencv-python](https://github.com/opencv/opencv-python) >=4
  * Only for the seekcamera-opencv sample

## Getting started :book:

We recommend that you jump right in by checking out one of the sample applications.
The sample applications demonstrate how to use the most common APIs and features in the SDK.

### Sample applications :bulb:

* seekcamera-opencv
  * Demonstrates how to image and display thermal frames to the screen using OpenCV's drawing functions.
* seekcamera-simple
  * Demonstrates how to export frame pixel values to disk as a CSV file.

Run the samples

```txt
cd seekcamera-python
python3 examples/seekcamera-opencv.py
```

### API documentation :brain:

API documentation is provided as standard Python docstrings.
Please refer to the more complete Seek Thermal SDK C Programming Guide which is provided with the SDK for more in-depth documentation.

## Installation :open_file_folder:

The Python language bindings are developed using Python 3.X.
We recommended Python 3.6+ since we test against those versions; older versions may work as well but we have not tested against them.

You can download Python from the official [website](https://wwww.python.org/downloads/).

The recommended method of installation is via the package on pypi

```txt
pip3 install seekcamera-python
```

Alternatively, you can install manually. To do so, after installing Python, clone this repository

```txt
git clone https://github.com/seekthermal/seekcamera-python.git
```

Change directories into the cloned repository

```txt
cd seekcamera-python
```

Install via [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip)

```txt
pip3 install -e .
```

### Dependencies :floppy_disk:

#### Python dependencies

Additional Python dependencies (required for some of the samples) can be installed via [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/).

```txt
pip3 install -r requirements.examples.txt
```

#### Other dependencies

The Python language bindings require the Seek Thermal SDK to be installed.
It is recommended, but not required, to use one of the SDK installers.
We provide Debian installers (`.deb`) for Linux and zipfile archives (`.zip`) for Windows.

On Windows, the SDK library (`seekcamera.dll`) should be located in one of the following places in order of precedence:

```txt
%SEEKTHERMAL_LIB_DIR%/
C:/Program Files/Seek Thermal/Seek Thermal SDK/4.X.X/x64-windows/lib
```

On Linux, the SDK library (`libseekcamera.so`) should be located in one of the following places in order of precedence:

```txt
$SEEKTHERMAL_LIB_DIR/
$LD_LIBRARY_PATH/
/lib/
/lib64/
/usr/lib/
/usr/lib64/
```

---

**NOTE**

`%SEEKTHERMAL_LIB_DIR%` is Windows environment variable and is (optionally) set by the user.

`$SEEKTHERMAL_LIB_DIR` is a Linux environment variable and is (optionally) set by the user.

The minimum SDK runtime version for each stable release of the Python language bindings is shown below:

      <th>seekcamera-python</th>
      <th>Minimum SDK runtime version</th>
    </tr>

      <td>1.0.0</td>
      <td>4.0.0</td>
    </tr>
